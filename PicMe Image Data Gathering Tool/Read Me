This data collection tool, namely PicMe, was created using Qt Creator.
The objective of this test application was to gather images of test subjects looking at different xy locations on a computer screen. With this objective in mind, an interface which incorporated on-screen targets was developed. The goal of the test was for the test subject to click on these targets one at a time as they appeared on screen. Only one target appeared on screen at a time and for the next target in the sequence to appear, the previous target button had to be clicked. Each time the target was clicked, an image was taken and a text file created which contained all the relevant information about the captured images.
