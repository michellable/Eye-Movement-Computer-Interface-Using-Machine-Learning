# Automated-Text-File-Editor
This folder contains code which was used to read specific lines of text in a text file and then to add new information to the end of the text file.
The purpose of this software was to read text files associated with images and subsequently to edit them. The images taken were of test subjects completing a target-clicking test, where a target target was moved around to different on-screen locations following a mouse click event. The purpose of this test was to gather images of the subjects position of eye gaze and at the time of clicking the on screen targets as well as to generate text files containing other information about the images.
The text files collected in early tests reported the xy location on screen of each mouse click but did not report the quadrant of the screen in which the mouse click occurred. The code in this repository was used to read through old text files and add the quadrant of the screen in which a mouse click occurred based on the xy coordinates recorded in original text files.
